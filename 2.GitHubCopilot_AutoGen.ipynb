    "## 1. GitHub Copilot 활성화 및 Agent Mode 소개\n",
    "\n",
    "이 실습에서는 GitHub Copilot의 Agent Mode를 활용합니다. 아래 내용을 참고하여 Copilot을 활성화하고, Edit/Chat 모드의 차이와 사용법을 익히세요.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GitHub Copilot 활성화 방법\n",
    "1. VS Code에서 [Extensions]에서 'GitHub Copilot'을 설치합니다.\n",
    "2. 상태바 또는 Command Palette(Cmd+Shift+P)에서 'Copilot: Sign In'을 선택해 GitHub 계정으로 로그인합니다.\n",
    "3. Copilot이 정상적으로 활성화되면, 에디터 우측 하단에 Copilot 아이콘이 표시됩니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Mode란?\n",
    "- **Agent Mode**는 Copilot이 단순 코드 자동완성(Inline) 기능을 넘어, 파일 편집(Edit)과 대화(Chat) 기반의 다양한 개발 작업을 지원하는 모드입니다.\n",
    "- Edit/Chat 모드 모두 Agent Mode의 일부로, 더 복잡한 작업을 Copilot이 직접 수행할 수 있습니다.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Edit 모드\n",
    "- 코드 파일에서 특정 영역을 선택한 뒤, Copilot 패널에서 \"Edit with Copilot\"을 클릭하면 선택 영역을 수정/리팩터링/설명/변환 등 다양한 작업을 요청할 수 있습니다.\n",
    "- 예시: 함수 블록을 선택 → \"함수에 타입 힌트 추가\" 요청\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chat 모드\n",
    "- Copilot Chat 패널(사이드바 또는 하단)에서 자연어로 질문하거나, 파일/코드/작업에 대한 지시를 내릴 수 있습니다.\n",
    "- 예시: \"이 파일의 주요 버그를 찾아줘\", \"이 함수의 시간복잡도를 설명해줘\"\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip:** 실습 중 코드 셀이나 파일에서 Copilot Chat에 `/edit` 명령어를 입력하면, 선택 영역을 Edit 모드로 바로 전환할 수 있습니다.\n",

      "---------- TextMessage (language_agent) ----------\n",
      "Traveling to Paris is a fantastic experience! Here are some important language and communication tips to help you navigate any challenges during your trip:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Basic French Phrases**: While many Parisians speak English, it's polite to know a few basic phrases in French. Common greetings like:\n",
      "   - “Bonjour” (Hello)\n",
      "   - “Merci” (Thank you)\n",
      "   - “S’il vous plaît” (Please)\n",
      "   - “Excusez-moi” (Excuse me)\n",
      "   Knowing these will often lead to a warmer reception.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Using a Translation App**: As you've noted, downloading a translation app like Google Translate can be incredibly helpful. You can use it to translate menus, street signs, or have basic conversations. Some apps also have offline capabilities if you won’t always have internet access.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Menu Language**: Many menus in tourist areas will be in English, but in local bistros or eateries, they may only be in French. Using your translation app or a phrasebook to check for dishes might be useful, and don't hesitate to ask the server if they can explain the specials in English.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Politeness is Key**: Always start with a polite greeting or “Bonjour” when entering shops or restaurants. It shows respect for the culture and can lead to a more positive interaction.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Hand Gestures and Non-Verbal Communication**: If language barriers arise, use gestures when appropriate. Pointing to items or using hand signals can help convey your message without words.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Learn to Count**: Knowing numbers can help you with prices, ordering meals, or navigating public transport. Practice counting in French to make these interactions smoother.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Cultural Differences in Communication**: French culture values politeness and formalities. Use \"vous\" (the formal 'you') instead of \"tu\" (the informal 'you') when addressing strangers or in more formal settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Keep Calm During Misunderstandings**: If you find yourself in a situation where communication is difficult, remain calm and patient. A friendly smile can go a long way, and it helps to be understanding that language barriers exist.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Tourist Information Points**: Don't hesitate to visit tourist offices where staff usually speak multiple languages and can provide maps, brochures, and assistance in English.\n",
